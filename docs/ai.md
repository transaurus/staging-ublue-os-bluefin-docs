## Methodology

Bluefin was created by engineers, but was brought to life by [Jacob Schnurr](https://www.etsy.com/shop/JSchnurrCommissions) and [Andy Frazer](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/dragonsofwales). The artwork is free for you to use and will always be made by humans. It is there to remind us that open source is an ecosystem that needs to be sustained. The software we make has an effect on the world. Bluefin's AI integration will always be user controlled, with a focus on open source models and tools.

:::tip[AI is an extension of cloud native]

Bluefin's focus in AI is providing a generic API endpoint to the operating system that is controlled by the user. Just as Bluefin's operating system is built with [CNCF](https://cncf.io) tech like `bootc` and `podman`, this experience is powered by [Agentic AI Foundation](https://aaif.io/) tech like `goose`. With a strong dash of the open source components that power [RHEL Lightspeed](https://www.redhat.com/en/lightspeed).

## Bluespeed

"Bluespeed" is our collection of Bluefin's [developer experience](/bluefin-dx) tools and support for AI development workflows. We do this via community managed set of tool recommendations and configuration. We believe that the operating system should have more API endpoints for AI.

- "Bring your own LLM" aproach, it should be easy to switch between local models and hosted ones
  - [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) as the primary interface to hosted and local models
- Accelerate open standards in AI by shipping tools from the [Agentic AI Foundation](https://aaif.io/), [CNCF](https://cncf.io), and other foundations
- Local LLM service management
  - Model management via `ramalama` and Docker Model, your choice
- GPU Acceleration for both Nvidia and AMD are included out of the box and usually do not require any extra setup
- Highlight great AI/ML applications on FlatHub in our curated section in the App Store
- A great reason to [sell more swag](https://store.projectbluefin.io)

We work closely with the [RHEL Lightspeed team](https://github.com/rhel-lightspeed) by shipping their code, giving feedback, and pushing the envelope where we can.

## AI Lab with Podman Desktop

The [AI Lab extension](https://developers.redhat.com/products/podman-desktop/podman-ai-lab) can be installed inside the included Podman Desktop to provide a graphical interface for managing local models:

## Ramalama

Install [Ramalama](https://github.com/containers/ramalama) via `brew install ramalama`: manage local models and is the preferred default experience. It's for people who work with local models frequently and need advanced features. It offers the ability to pull models from huggingface, ollama, and any container registry. By default it pulls from ollama.com, check the [Ramalama documentation](https://github.com/containers/ramalama/tree/main/docs) for more information.

Ramalama's command line experience is similar to Podman. Bluefin sets `rl` as an alias for `ramalama`, for brevity. Examples include:

```
rl pull llama3.2:latest
rl run llama3.2
rl run deepseek-r1
```

You can also serve the models locally:

```
rl serve deepseek-r1
```

Then go to `http://127.0.0.0:8080` in your browser.

Ramalama will automatically pull in anything your host needs to do the workload. The images are also stored in the same container storage as your other containers. This allows for centralized management of the models and other podman images:

```
❯ podman images
REPOSITORY                                 TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED        SIZE
quay.io/ramalama/rocm                      latest      8875feffdb87  5 days ago     6.92 GB
```

### Integrating with Existing Tools

`ramalama serve` will serve an OpenAI compatible endpoint at `http://0.0.0.0:8080`, you can use this to configure tools that do not support ramalama directly:

### Other Ramalama tips

- Force Vulkan instead of ROCm: `ramalama serve --image quay.io/ramalama/ramalama gpt-oss:latest`
- Strix Halo users: `ramalama serve --image docker.io/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes:vulkan-radv gpt-oss:latest`
  - Check out [AMD Strix Halo Llama.cpp Toolboxes](https://github.com/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes) and [Donato Capitella's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@donatocapitella) for more information

### Running AI Agents in VS Code

Here is an example of using devcontainers to run agents inside containers for isolation:

## Docker Model Runner

[TBD]

## Alpaca Graphical Client

For light chatbot usage we recommend that users [install Alpaca](https://flathub.org/apps/com.jeffser.Alpaca) to manage and chat with your LLM models from within a native desktop application. Alpaca supports Nvidia and AMD[^1] acceleration natively.

:::tip[Only a keystroke away]

Bluefin binds `Ctrl`-`Alt`-`Backspace` as a quicklaunch for Alpaca automatically after you install it!
