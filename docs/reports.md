# Monthly Reports

Monthly reports provide transparent, data-driven summaries of completed work, active contributors, and project momentum from the [Bluefin Project Board](https://todo.projectbluefin.io).

## What Are Monthly Reports?

Monthly reports are automatically generated each month, summarizing:

- **Completed Work:** Items moved to "Done" on the project board, categorized by area and type
- **Contributors:** Everyone who contributed during the period, with special recognition for first-time contributors
- **Bot Activity:** Automated dependency updates and maintenance tasks
- **Project Status:** ChillOps philosophy indicators for each project area

Reports are published monthly covering the previous month's activity.

## ChillOps Philosophy

Bluefin follows a "ChillOps" development philosophy:

- **No artificial urgency:** Work progresses at sustainable pace
- **Quality over velocity:** Thoughtful development beats rushed releases
- **Community-driven:** Contributors work on what interests them
- **Transparent:** All work visible on public project board

When a project area shows "Status: ChillOps" in reports, it means work is progressing steadily without pressure or burnout.

## How Reports Differ from Changelogs and Blog

Understanding the content types:

| Content Type   | Purpose                                | Frequency   | Source                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| **Changelogs** | OS release notes with package versions | Per release | GitHub Releases          |
| **Blog Posts** | Deep dives, announcements, tutorials   | Ad-hoc      | Manual authoring         |
| **Reports**    | Project activity summaries             | Monthly     | Project board automation |

**Use changelogs** to see what changed in a specific OS release.  
**Use blog posts** for detailed explanations and guides.  
**Use reports** to track project momentum and contributor activity.

## Automated Generation

Reports are 100% automatically generated from the project board:

1. Monthly on the last day of the month at 10:00 UTC
2. GitHub Actions workflow fetches project board data
3. Script categorizes completed items by labels
4. Markdown report generated and committed
5. Site rebuilds and deploys automatically

No manual curation or editing. What you see reflects actual project board state.
